Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Matt, a selfhoster who sometimes makes guides for others when something really annoys me.


# What You'll Find Here

- Guides for selfhosted related things.
- Automations (probably for selfhosted things)
  
## Wtf is mafyuh?
When I was 9 I needed a unique username for Google. My full name is Matthew, if you say mafyuh fast it *sort-of* sounds the same. Anyways, it stuck. The google account didn't though :(
