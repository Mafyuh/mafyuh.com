Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Matt Reeves, a DevOps and GitOps enthusiast with a passion for self-hosting.

Before diving into the world of DevOps and GitOps, I honed my skills as an advanced electronics repair technician, tackling complex challenges with multimeters, oscilloscopes, and soldering irons. From troubleshooting intricate circuits to mastering surface-mount technology (SMT), I thrived on solving problems and learning what's possible in electronics.

While I continue to stay up-to-date with hardware, my focus has shifted more towards the software side of things. Just as I mastered the intricacies of hardware, I'm now determined to delve into the world of software and emerge as a master of DevOps, GitOps, and system administration. With the same dedication and hunger for knowledge that drove me in the realm of electronics, I'm excited to tackle the challenges of software development and infrastructure management head-on.
